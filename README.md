**Central Data Repository README**

Welcome to [Central Data Repository! This README will guide you through setting up the Rust project, including installation instructions for Rust and other dependencies. Additionally, it will provide guidance on writing code and deploying the project in a production environment on UNIX systems.

## Setting up the Rust Project

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Rust: The Rust programming language and its package manager Cargo. You can install Rust using `rustup`, which is a toolchain manager for Rust. Follow the instructions on the official website: [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```

2. Build the project:

```bash
cargo build
```

3. Run tests (optional):

```bash
cargo test
```

## Writing Code

When contributing to the project, follow these guidelines to maintain consistency and ensure code quality:

- **Follow Rust naming conventions**: Use snake_case for function and variable names, and CamelCase for types and traits.
- **Write comprehensive documentation**: Document your code using Rust's documentation comments (`///`) to provide clear explanations of functions, structs, and modules.
- **Use Rust's standard library**: Whenever possible, leverage Rust's standard library for common tasks to ensure performance and reliability.
- **Follow the project's coding style**: Consistency is key. Follow the existing code style and formatting conventions used in the project.

## Deployment in Production (UNIX)

### Prerequisites

Before deploying the project in a production environment, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- UNIX-based operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS)
- Access to a server where you want to deploy the project
- Docker (optional, but recommended for containerization)

### Steps

1. Build the project for release:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

2. Set up your production environment:

   - Install any necessary dependencies (e.g., database, web server).
   - Configure environment variables for your production settings.

3. Copy the built binary to your server:

```bash
scp target/release/<project_name> user@server:/path/to/deployment/directory
```

4. SSH into your server:

```bash
ssh user@server
```

5. Run the binary:

```bash
./<project_name>
```

6. (Optional) Containerization with Docker:

   - Create a Dockerfile in your project directory:

```Dockerfile
FROM rust:latest as builder

WORKDIR /usr/src/<project_name>
COPY . .

RUN cargo build --release

FROM debian:buster-slim

WORKDIR /usr/src/<project_name>

COPY --from=builder /usr/src/<project_name>/target/release/<project_name> .

CMD ["./<project_name>"]
```

   - Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t <project_name> .
```

   - Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p <host_port>:<container_port> <project_name>
```

Replace `<project_name>` with the name of your project and configure ports as needed.
